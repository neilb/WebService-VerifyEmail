=head1 NAME

WebService::VerifyEmail - check validity of an email address using verify-email.org

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use WebService::VerifyEmail;
  
  my $verifier = WebService::VerifyEmail->new(
                    username => $username,
                    password => $password,
                    );
  
  print "Email is ", $verifier->email_ok($email)
                     ? 'GOOD'
                     : 'BAD', "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WebService::VerifyEmail is an interface to the service at
L<verify-email.org|http://verify-email.org> which is used to check
whether an email address is bad.

The simplest way to use this module is the example given in the SYNOPSIS above.
The module also provides a C<check_email()> method, which returns an object
with more information:

  $response = $verifier->check_email($email);
  if ($response->verify_status) {
     print "$email is GOOD\n";
  } else {
     print "$email is BAD:\n",
           "  auth status:  ", $response->authentication_status, "\n",
           "  limit status: ", $response->limit_status, "\n",
           "  limit desc:   ", $response->limit_desc, "\n",
           "  verify desc:   ", $response->verify_status_desc, "\n";
  }

The C<verify_status> field is B<1> if the email address is good,
and C<0> if the email address is bad (caveat: see L<KNOWN BUGS>).
I'm not sure about the other fields at the moment, but when I've had
clarification, I'll update this documentation :-)

verify-email.org is a commercial service: there is a free level,
but you can only check a small number of email addresses with that.
You'll have to pay if you want to check any serious
number of email addresses.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

You can get false positives from the service: an email address can
be reported as good, but then when you try and send email to it, you get a bounce.
That's just the reality of the email infrastructure.

from basic format checks upwards.
